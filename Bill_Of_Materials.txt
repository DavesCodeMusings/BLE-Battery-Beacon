This project uses the venerable ESP32 Devkit V1 for both the BLE device and the ESPHome Bluetooth proxy.

2 x ESP32 Devkit V1  https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ESP32+devkit+v1
2 x USB A to Micro B cable https://www.amazon.com/s?k=USB+A+to+Micro+USB+cable
1 x Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
1 x ESP32 Board Library for Arduino https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html
1 x Home Assistant installation https://www.home-assistant.io/
1 x WiFi network

Important Note:
The examples here use the 3.0.x board library for ESP32. Many examples on the web still refer to the 2.0.x version.
esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup() and possibly other functions have changed between versions. Compilation will fail
if you're not using the 3.0.x version.
